* TODO
** DONE
- [X] added command line options for changing resolution on startup
- [X] change position pixel data from std::vector to std::list
- [X] refactor names, they don't need to prefixed with type
- [X] split the pge and physobj classes into seperate modules
- [X] add the ability for the balls to rotate
- [X] reserve space in vector holding the balls
- [X] add accessors and mutators and make datamembers private
    - [X] in Sim.cpp: all references to b.Position/Velocity/Acceleration
      must be replaced with approprate getters/setters. New setters may
      need to be made
- [X] fix collision so that the balls don't get stuck in eachother or wall
- [X] add mass to the balls and incorporate momentum
- [X] print ball debug info to stdout
- [X] Add air resistance parameter
** IN PROGRESS
- [-] changing the resolution dramatically lowers the framerate
- [-] move everything physics related into physobj
In PhysObj:
** NOT STARTED
In PhysObj:
    - [] break up PhysObj and Ball files
    - [] use VertexIndex
In Sim:
    - [] the numbers used in DisplayComponents() should be dynamically derived from pge and not hard coded
    - [] should sim::vector<ball> be a std::list instead?
    - [] break up onUserUpdate/Create and other Sim methods
